I've learned how to create the .bash_profile file that I didn't have on OS X, and then how to edit it to allow opening Sublime Text 2 by just typing "subl".

To create the file from the command prompt:
http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/99835/how-to-create-bash-profile-and-profile

	cd ~
	sudo nano .bash_profile

Then added the following line to the newly created file:
	
	export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin

Then pressed Ctrl+O to write the file out, then Ctrl+x to close out of nano.

To refresh the terminal, you could close or reopen, but I also saw you can just type 
	. .bash_profile
And the changes worked, because I was then able to type in 
	cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
	mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
	cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
	mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
	cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
	subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_reflections.txt (you can replace subl with another editor here if you prefer a different one)

And here I was.
